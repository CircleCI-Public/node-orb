    Install custom versions of Node.js, and optionally NPM/Yarn, in any
    execution environment (Docker/Linux, macOS, machine) that does not have
    it preinstalled.

    Recommendation: It is highly recommended to utilize an environment such as Docker with Node preinstalled.

parameters:
    # node
    node-version:
        type: string
        default: ''
        description: >
            Specify the full version tag to install. To install the latest version, set the version to `latest`.
            If unspecified, the version listed in .nvmrc will be installed. If no .nvmrc file exists the active LTS version of Node.js will be installed by default.
