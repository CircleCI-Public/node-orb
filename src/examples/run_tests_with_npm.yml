  How to quickly and easily run your Node.js tests on CircleCI with caching automatically included. This example assumes you are using NPM as your package manager.
  The "npm ci" command will automatically be applied and the "~/.npm" directory cached.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    node: circleci/node:x.y # This version number refers to the version of the orb, not the version of NodeJS
  jobs:
    test:
      executor:
        name: node/default
        tag: "13.14" # You could specify the node version via the docker image.
      steps:
        - checkout
        - node/install-packages
        - run:
            command: npm run test
  workflows:
    test_my_app:
      jobs:
        - test
