    By default, the "install-packages" command will attempt to utilize "bun install". The command can however be overwritten to support an alternative package install command such as "bun install --frozen-lockfile".
usage:
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
        node: circleci/node@x.y # This version number refers to the version of the orb, not the version of Node.js
    jobs:
        test:
            executor: node/default
            steps:
                - checkout
                - node/install-bun:
                      version: "1.2.22" # Specify Bun version, or omit for latest
                - node/install-packages:
                      pkg-manager: bun
                      # The orb automatically caches ~/.bun/install/cache by default
                      # You can override with cache-path: here if you need a custom location
                - run: bun run test
