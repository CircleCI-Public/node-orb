    Drop-in solution to automatically test your Node.js applications. This job will automatically download your code into any version node environment, install your dependencies with caching enabled, and execute your testing script.
    This example shows how easily with two orbs you can test your Node application and automatically deploy to Heroku when successful, and on the master branch.
usage:
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
        node: circleci/node@x.y # This version number refers to the version of the orb, not the version of Node.js
        heroku: circleci/heroku@x.y
    workflows:
        test-and-deploy:
            jobs:
                - node/test
                - heroku/deploy-via-git:
                      requires:
                          - node/test
                      filters:
                          branches:
                              only:
                                  - master
