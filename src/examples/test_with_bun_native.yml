    Use the test job with Bun's native test runner for automatic test result collection.
    When using "test-results-for: bun" with "pkg-manager: bun", the orb will automatically:
    - Run Bun's built-in test runner with JUnit output
    - Collect and store test results for CircleCI's test summary
    Note: This is different from "test-results-for: jest" which runs Jest with Bun acting as a script runner.
usage:
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
        node: circleci/node@x.y
    workflows:
        test_my_app:
            jobs:
                # Use Bun's native test runner with automatic JUnit output
                - node/test:
                      name: test-with-bun-native
                      pkg-manager: bun
                      test-results-for: bun
                      setup:
                          - node/install-bun:
                                version: '1.2.22'

                # Or use Jest through Bun (requires jest-junit package)
                - node/test:
                      name: test-with-jest-via-bun
                      pkg-manager: bun
                      test-results-for: jest
                      run-command: test:jest # Your package.json script that runs Jest
                      setup:
                          - node/install-bun:
                                version: '1.2.22'
